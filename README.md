# Stegosaurus
Simple CLI based steganography program built by JP Arena and I. You can check his work out here: https://github.com/jparena
This program uses the Pillow and Cryptography libraries.
Simply type PIP install Pillow on command line, do the same for Cryptography.
The password implementation uses SHA-256 and was implemnted by JP Arena.
Passwords are encrypted and stored in the image along with the message. Each image has its own password so make note of which one you used for which.
